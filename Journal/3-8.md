I've finished the WSJ, Seeking Alpha articles, programming subreddit, etc. It's only 11:30. 

I have half a mind to take a half day to work on my website. At least get the admin dashboard working so I can finally reach a point where I can start accessing stock financial data. 

I want to see some progress on it today. I may even take a vyvanse.

# Grabbing the rest of the coffee, going to take an hour to regroup and then head out to work on my website. 

Right now I have users dashboard up and running. I need to implement roles first, with the ability to create roles and assign roles to users. 

Then, I can work on creating and removing Stocks, with simple price data, etc. 

Then, I can work on adding stock tracking to Portfolios, which will simply consist of "Trades" with stock IDs, prices, shares, history, etc. 

# I'll need a Trades database most likely. 

Off the top of my head I'll be editing modals and updating information that way. 

Also re-doing the database to destroy the relationships I mistakenly set up in favor of something I can actually control. 

The relationships may be needed. But it's so damn confusing. 

# I just want a database with Users, Roles, Stocks, Trades, and Portfolios.
Users have a Role and a Portfolio. 
Roles belong to User. 
Portfolio has many Trades. 
Trade belongs to Portfolio, and had a Stock. 
Stock belongs to Trade. 

Seriously, fuck these relationships. I'll create and store the collections of references myself.
