I've finished the WSJ, Seeking Alpha articles, programming subreddit, etc. It's only 11:30. 

I have half a mind to take a half day to work on my website. At least get the admin dashboard working so I can finally reach a point where I can start accessing stock financial data. 

I want to see some progress on it today. I may even take a vyvanse.
