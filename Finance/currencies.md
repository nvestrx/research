# Currency

* Currency strength expresses the value of currency, and is often calculated as **purchasing power**. 
* Currency value can also be calculated against the value of other currencies. 

# Pros and Cons of Strong Currency

## Pros
1. Travelling abroad is cheaper. Encourages vacations in other countries. 
2. Imports are cheaper. Goods produced abroad and imported will be cheaper if the manufacturers currency falls in value. Luxury cars from Europe will fall in price. Companies that import raw materials will have lower cost of production, and thus enjoy more profit. 
3. The status of the dollar as a world reserve currency is bolstered. Since demand is high worldwide, it will be accepted and converted just about anywhere, which is powerful. 
## Cons

1. Tourism to the US is expensive, it's harder to come here from a poorer country and more expensive to live here. 
2. Exporters will suffer. Their domestically produced goods become relatively more expensive abroad. 
3. Domestic companies that do a lot of business abroad will be hurt. Investors in companies who deal and make sales abroad will be hurt. 
4. Foreign government who require your dollar reserves will end up paying relatively more to obtain these dollars. 

## Currency Intervention/Manipulation

* Currency manipulation occurs when a government or central bank buys or sells foreign currency in exchange for their own domestic currency, generally with the intention of influencing the exchange rate.
* Objectives for manipulation:
1. Controlling inflation
2. Maintaining competitiveness
3. Maintaining financial stability. 

## Purposes

* Central banks generally agree that the primary objective of foreing exhange market intervention is to manage the volatility and/or influence the level of the exchange rate. 
* Stabilization of the exchange rate is good because excessive short-term volatility erodes market confidence and affects both the financial market and the real goods market. 

## History

* Currency intervention was used to help maintain exchange rates within prescribed margins during the Cold War era under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates. 
* The end of the traditional Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s and the move to **manage currencies** led to a large scale increase in currency intervention throughout the 70s and 80s. 

### Direct intervention

* Sterilized Intervention
A policy that attempts to influence the exchange rate without changing the monetary base. 
It's a combination of two transactions:
1. First, central bank conducts a non-sterilized intervention by buying (selling) foreing currency bonds using domestic currency that it issues. 
2. Second, the central bank sterilizes the effects on the monetary base by selling (buying) a corresponding quantity of domestic-currency-denominated bonds to soak up the initial increase (decrease) of the domestic currency. 
The net effect is the same as a swap of domestic currency bonds for foreign currency bonds with no change in money supply. 
3. Example: if desiring to decrease the exchange rate/price of a domestic currency without changing the monetary base, authorities purchase foreign currency bonds, the sells an equal amount of domestic currency bonds, so that the total money supply is back to the original level. 
* Non sterilized Intervention:
If aiming at decreasing the exchange rate/price of the domestic currency, authorities could purchase foreign currency bonds. During this transaction, extra supply of domestic currency will drag down domestic currency price, and extra demand of foreign currency will push up the foreign currency price. As a result, the exchange rate drops. 

## Modern Examples

There are four groups of frequent currency manipulators:

1. Longstanding advanced/developed economies: Japan, Switzerland
2. Newly industrialized economies: Singapore
3. Developing Asian economies: China
4. Oil exporters: Russia

UBS, largest private banker (Swiss), was fined for currency manipulation in 2014. 

There are several examples of modern currency manipulation, including the Swiss france drop in 2007-2008, the Japanese fight against deflation, and of course Chinese manipulation of their yuan against our dollar. 

1. **Swiss france**
The fran appreciated during the 08 crisis due to a flight to safety and to the repayment of Swiss franc liabilities funding carry trades in high yielding currencies. 

In 2009, the Swiss National Bank announced that it intended to buy foreign exchange to prevent the Swiss france from appreciating further. 

At the end of 2009, currency risk seemed to be solved and SNB changed its attitude to preventing substantial appreciation. 

Unfortunately it continued to go up, causing the SNB to step in once again and intervene, until June 2010, where in total it had purchased an equivalent of $180 billion worth of Euros and Dollars, amounting to 33% of Swiss GDP, and set a minimum exchange rate of SFr 1.2 to the Euro. 

In 2015, the SNB dropped its commitment to hold the SFr at the fixed exchange rate, and thus the SFr soared, causing the Euro to fall 40% in value compared to the SFr. Investors flocked to the franc, driving up its value, which is bad, because the Swiss economy is heavily reliant on selling things abroad. To lower the francs value, the SNB created new francs and used them to buy Euros. 

2. **Japanese yen**

From 1989-2003, Japan suffered from deflation. As deflation preogressed, unemployment rose, confidence in finance declines, and banks failed. 

Devaluation of the yen continued by the Bank of Japan, in order to re-invigorate the market. In 2013, Japan announced its intentions of purposefully devaluing the yen, criticized by the US, after Group of Seven economies jointly intervened to weaken the currency in the aftermath of the record earthquake and tsunami that year. 

3. **Chinese yuan**

Chinas central bank has allegedly devalued the yuan by buying large amounts of US dollars with yuan, increasing supply of yuan and increasing demand for US dollars. They hold roughly $3.3 trillion at their foreign exchange, and 60% of it is in US government bonds and debentures. 

By devaluing the yuan, its exports are cheapened as its cost is measured in yuan, but since it's being sold in dollars, the profit is marked up, generating a dollar surplus.
