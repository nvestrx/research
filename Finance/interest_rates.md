# Interest Rates

## Basic interest rate information

* Interest rates are rewards for the risk that borrowers won't pay back the loan. 
* Lower interest rates allow consumers more money to spend, businesses/farmers are encouraged to purchase more equipment. 
* Traders rejoice when Fed drops the rate. 
* Higher interest rates means consumers cut back on spending. 
* High interest rates + increased lending standards means fewer loans for banks, and affects businesses/farmers. 

## Effects on Inflation

* Inflation is rise in prices of goods/services over time. 
* Federal funds rates are rates at which banks lend each other money, and are indicators of general interest rates. 
* Fed watches Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI). 
* When these indicators start to rise more than 2-3% a year, the Fed will raise federal funds rate to keep rising prices under control. 
* higher interest rates means people spend less, which will lower demand, and cause inflation to fall. 

## Examples 

* In 1981-1982, inflation was at 14% a year and Fed raised interest rates to 20%. 
* Caused a severe recession, but it put an end to the inflation the country was seeing. 
* In 2001-2002, Fed cut rates to 1.25%, contributing to the economies 2003 recovery. 


## Bonds

* Bond prices and interest rates have inverse relationship. 
* The longer the maturity of the bond, the more it fluctuates. 
* If interest rates are low, bond prices will be over-priced and have farther to fall, as inflation continues to grow. 
* That also means bond prices are so high that the government is earning the most it can from current bond prices, and that revenue is likely to decrease soon. 

## Interest Rate That Impacts Stocks

* Federal funds rate is the interest rate that affects the stock market. 
* Also known as the **overnight rate**.
* This is the cost that depository institutions are charged for borrowing money from the Federal Reserve banks (inter-bank loan)
* At the onset of a weakening economy, lower rates is not enough to offset loss of economic activity. 
* Towards the end of a boom cycle, when the Fed is moving in to raise rates, certain sectors continue to do well, like:
1. Tech stocks
2. Growth Stocks
3. Entertainment/Recreational stocks
* If interest rate is set too low, it causes the dollar to fall in the world market. 
* Low interest rate means people aren't saving money in banks, and encourages debt as people spend wildly. 
* Instead of paying off their debts, they leave principal to remain, leading to potentially more defaults, which is terrible.
